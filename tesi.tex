\begin{theorem}\label{thm:CohomMuN}
    Let $K$ be a $p$-adic field and $n$ a positive integer.
    Then,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\H{1}{\K}{\mu_n} = \K^\times/\K^{\times n}$ is a finite group,
        \item $\H{2}{\K}{\mu_n} = \Z/n\Z$, and
        \item $\H{i}{\K}{\mu_n} = 0$ for $i\geq 3$.
    \end{itemize}
    In particular, $\H{i}{\K}{\mu_n}$ is finite for all $i$ (for $i=0$ it's just the invariants of $\mu_n$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The first isomorphism follows from \textit{Kummer Theory} \eqref{eq:Kummer}. We can show that $\K^\times/\K^{\times n}$ is finite using the structure theorem for local fields \ref{thm:StructureLocalFields}:
    \[
        \K^\times/\K^{\times n} \simeq \Zn \times \kappa^\times/\kappa^{\times n} \times U_\K^1/(U_\K^1)^n,
    \]
    where $\kappa$ is the residue field of $\K$ (which is finite), and
    \[
        U_\K^1/(U_\K^1)^n \simeq \Zp^{[\K:\Qp]}/n \Zp^{[\K:\Qp]}
        \times F/F^n \simeq \Zn \times F/F^n
        ,\]
    again by Theorem \ref{thm:StructureLocalFields}. Since $F$ is a finite group, we are done.

    For second isomorphism, $\H{2}{\K}{\mu_n}$ is by definition the Brauer group of $\K$, and by Theorem \ref{thm:padicBrauer} $\Br{\K}$ is isomorphic to $\Q/\Z$, so we get
    \[
        \H{2}{\K}{\mu_n} = \Br{\K}[n] \simeq \ssfrac{\frac{1}{n}\Z}{\Z} = \Z/n\Z.
    \]
    Finally, we have shown in the previous section that the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic field has cohomological dimension 2, and since $\mu_n$ is torsion we are done.
\end{proof}

% TODO remark 8.14 about char p (which implies that duality holds for p-torsion-free modules)

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:FinCohom}
    If $\K$ is a $p$-adic field and $M$ is a finite $\Gamma_K$-module, then
    \(\H{i}{\K}{M}\) is finite for all $i$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Let $M=\{m_1,\ldots,m_n\}$. Then, the open subgroup
    \[
        U\coloneqq \bigcap_{i=1}^n{\St(m_i)}
    \]
    acts trivially on $M$, and by Galois theory it corresponds to a finite extension $L^{\prime} $. Then, the absolute Galois group of $L\coloneqq L^{\prime}(\mu_n)$ acts trivially on both $M$ and $\mu_n$. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, $M$ is isomorphic (as a $\Gamma_L$-module) to the direct sum of finitely many $\mu_k$, with $k\mid n$.

    However, by the previous theorem $\H{i}{L}{\mu_k}$ is finite for all $i$, so $\H{i}{L}{M}$ is finite as well by additivity. Now, using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence \eqref{eq:HS}:
    \[
        E_2^{pq}= \H{p}{\mathrm{Gal}{(L / \K)}}{\H{q}{L}{M}} \Rightarrow \H{p+q}{\K}{M}
    \]
    we see that $\H{i}{K}{M}$ is finite, as it has a finite filtration whose successive quotients are subquotients of the finite groups $E_2^{pq}$ (which are finite as cohomology groups of a finite module, since $\mathrm{Gal}(L /\K)$ is finite).
\end{proof}

\chapter{Local Duality}
In this chapter we are going to define a product on cohomology, the \textit{cup product}, and work through its properties and compatibility with various pairings.

Using the cup product and the previous results on the structure of local fields, we'll prove Tate's local duality theorem for finite modules over the absolute Galois group $\Gamma$ of a $p$-adic field, for which we'll need to show the existence of a dualizing module for $G$, which represents the Pontryagin dual of a specific cohomology functor.

We will then apply all of this machinery by computing the abelianized absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic field, which describes the finite abelian extensions of $\K$.

\section{Cup Product}

Let $G$ be a profinite group. Given two $G$-modules $A$ and $B$, we consider their tensor product $A\otimes B$ (over $\Z$) with the natural $G$-module structure
\[
    g\cdot (a\otimes b)=g\cdot a\otimes g\cdot b,
\]
which extends to a bi-additive map on \textit{homogeneous} cochains
\begin{align*}
    K^p(G,A)\times K^q(G,B) & \overset{\cup}{\longrightarrow} K^{p+q}(G,A\otimes B) \\
    (a,b)                   & \mapsto a\cup b,
\end{align*}
by setting
\[
    (a\cup b)(g_0,\dots g_{p+q})=a(g_0,\dots,g_p)\otimes b(g_p,\dots,g_{p+q}).
\]

This extends to a map on cohomology groups:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:Cup}
    The cup product induces a bi-additive map
    \begin{align*}
        \cup: \H{p}{G}{A}\times\H{q}{G}{B} & \longrightarrow \H{p+q}{G}{A\otimes B} \\
        (\alpha,\beta)                     & \longmapsto \alpha\cup\beta.
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We only need to prove that the cup product is well-defined, i.e. that it sends pairs of cocycles of $Z^p(G,A)\times Z^q(G,B)$ in cocycles of $Z^{p+q}(G,A\otimes B)$, and that changing one of such representatives by a coboundary doesn't change the cohomology class of the image.
    It's enough to prove the following formula:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:DiffCup}
        d(a\cup b)=da\cup b+(-1)^pa\cup d b,
    \end{equation}
    whose computation follows readily from the definition of the coboundary by cancelling out terms with opposite signs in the right hand side.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rm:Cup0n}
    Note that for $p=0$, the cup product with a fixed element $a\in \H{0}{G}{A}=A^G$ is a map
    \[
        \H{q}{G}{B}\to\H{q}{G}{A\otimes B}
    \]
    induced by
    \begin{align*}
        B & \longrightarrow A\otimes B \\
        b & \longmapsto a\otimes b,
    \end{align*}
    as is readily checked on cocycles.

    In the case $p=q=0$, we get that the cup product on invariants is just the tensor product $$A^G\otimes B^G\to (A\otimes B)^G.$$
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
    A \textit{pairing} of $G$-modules is a bi-additive map $\varphi: A\times B\to C$ which is $G$-equivariant, i.e. such that
    \[
        \varphi(g\cdot a,\,g\cdot b)=g\cdot\varphi(a,b)
    \]
    for all $a\in A$, $b\in B$, and $g\in G$.
\end{definition}

Since any such pairing induces a map $\overline{\varphi}: A\otimes B\to C$, we can use the cup product to define a pairing on cohomology, which we will denote by the same symbol by a slight abuse of notation:

\[
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small]
        {\H{p}{G}{A}\times\H{q}{G}{B}} \ar[rd] \ar[rr, "\cup"] && \H{p+q}{G}{C}\\
        & \H{p+q}{G}{A\otimes B} \ar[ru, swap, "\overline{\varphi}^*"]
    \end{tikzcd}
\]

In order to prove the duality theorem, we will need the following compatibility of the cup product with exact sequences:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:CompatCupDiff}
    Suppose we have exact sequences of $G$-modules
    \[
        0\longrightarrow A\longrightarrow B\longrightarrow C\longrightarrow 0,\qquad
        0\longrightarrow A^{\prime}\longrightarrow B^{\prime}\longrightarrow C^{\prime}\longrightarrow 0
    \]
    and a pairing $\varphi: B\times B^{\prime} \to D$ that sends $A\times A^{\prime}$ to $0$, so that it induces pairings
    $$\varphi^{\prime} : A\times C^{\prime} \to D$$
    and
    $$\varphi^{\prime\prime} : A^{\prime} \times C \to D.$$
    Then, the cup products associated with $\varphi^{\prime}, \varphi^{\prime\prime}$ are compatible (up to sign) with the coboundaries of the long exact sequences in cohomology:
    \[
        \delta\gamma\cup\gamma^{\prime} +(-1)^p(\gamma\cup\delta\gamma^{\prime} )=0
    \]
    for all $\gamma\in\H{p}{G}{C}$ and $\gamma^{\prime} \in\H{q-1}{G}{C^{\prime}}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We need explicit the connecting homomorphisms: lift $\gamma$ and $\gamma^{\prime} $ to cocycles $c$ and $c^{\prime}$, and lift those respectively to $b\in K^p(B)$ and $b^{\prime} \in K^{q-1}(B^{\prime} )$. Their images $db$ and $db^{\prime} $ then come from some $a\in K^{p+1}(A)$ and $a^{\prime} \in K^q(A^{\prime} )$ respectively, which are representatives for $\delta \gamma$ and $\delta \gamma^{\prime} $.

    Now, by \eqref{eq:DiffCup} the \textit{coboundary} $d(b\cup b^{\prime} )$ is equal to $$db\cup b^{\prime} +(-1)^p b\cup db^{\prime} = a\cup c^{\prime}  + (-1)^p c \cup a^{\prime},$$ which gives us the result by passing to cohomology.
\end{proof}

\section{Dualizing Module}

In this section we introduce the dualizing module, a type of object which is central in the study of any duality. While it can be defined explicitly (as done in e.g. \cite{Neukirch}),
we are going to prove its existence by homological methods and only compute it for the absolute Galois group of a p-adic field, which suffices to prove the duality theorem. We
start by introducing the type of duality we are interested in:

\begin{definition}
    If \(A\) is an abelian group, we define the \textit{Pontryagin dual} of \(A\) as

    \[
        A^*\coloneqq \Hom_{c}(A,\Q/\Z)
        .\]
    If \(A\) is torsion, \(A^*=\Hom(A,\Q/\Z)\) is profinite with the compact-open topology.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{rm:Pontryagin}
    The functor \(A\mapsto A^*\)  induces an equivalence of categories

    \[
        \{ \text{Torsion abelian groups} \}^{\text{op}}  \cong \{ \text{Profinite abelian groups}, \}
    \]

    as a special case of Pontryagin duality for locally compact abelian groups.
    For a finite abelian group \(A\), the structure theorem yields a (non-canonical) isomorphism \(A\Iso A^*\), and by cardinality considerations we have the canonical isomorphism
    \begin{align*}
        A & \Iso A^{**}                           \\
        b & \mapsto \left( f\mapsto f(b) \right).
    \end{align*}

    Generalizing to torsion abelian groups, we can write such an \(A\) as the inductive limit of its finite subgroups \(A_i\) to get

    \[
        A^* = \Hom(\varinjlim_i A_i,\Q/\Z) = \varprojlim_i A_i^*,
    \]

    which is a profinite group. Viceversa, if \(G\) is an abelian profinite group, we can write it as the projective limit of its finite quotients \(G_i\), and then

    \[
        G^* = \Hom_{c}( \varprojlim_i G_i,\Q/\Z ) = \varinjlim_i G_i^*
    \]

    is a torsion group. One checks that this actually induces an equivalence of categories, for which we refer to \cite{RibesZalesskii}, \S 2.9.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Existence}

Now, given a profinite group \(G\) of finite cohomological dimension \(\cd(G)=n\), denote by \(\Gfmod\) the category of finite discrete \(G\)-modules.
Then, by the previous remark we have a contravariant left-exact functor
\begin{align}\label{eq:CohomDual}
    \Gfmod & \to \Ab                \\
    A      & \mapsto \H{n}{G}{A}^*:
\end{align}
indeed, \(^*\) is an exact functor because it induces an equivalence, and using the long exact sequence we see that the \(n\)-th cohomology functor is right-exact, so their composition is left-exact by contravariance of \(^*\).

The dualizing module is defined through the following theorem, which gives sufficient conditions to the representability of this functor:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:DualMod}
    Let \(G\) be a profinite group of finite cohomological dimension \(\cd(G)=n\) such that \(\H{n}{G}{A}\) is finite for all \(A\in\Gfmod\).

    Then, the functor \eqref{eq:CohomDual} is representable in the category \(\Gfmod\): there exists a torsion discrete \(G\)-module \(I\) together with a natural isomorphism
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FuncIso}
        \Hom_G\left( -,I \right) \simeq \H{n}{G}{-}^*
    \end{equation}
    of functors \(\Gfmod\to\Ab\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    In the situation of Theorem \ref{thm:DualMod}, \(I\) is called the \textit{dualizing module} of \(G\).
\end{definition}

The proof uses a lemma from homological algebra, for which we give a basic definition:

\begin{definition}
    A category \(\mathcal{C}\) is \textit{Noetherian} if:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it is \textit{essentially small} (i.e. it's equivalent to a category whose objects form a set), and
        \item every object \(C\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) is \textit{Noetherian} (i.e. every ascending chain of subobjects of \(C\) stabilizes).
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:IndRep}
    Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a Noetherian Abelian category, and \(F: \mathcal{C}\to\Ab\) a contravariant left-exact functor.
    Then, \(F\) is \textup{Ind}-representable: there exists a filtered inductive system \((I_j)\) of objects in \(\mathcal{C}\) such that \(F\) is naturally isomorphic to the functor
    \[A\mapsto \varinjlim_j \Hom(A, I_j).\]
\end{lemma}

We first show how this implies the existence of the dualizing module:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:DualMod}]
    We apply Lemma \ref{lm:IndRep} to the functor \(\H{n}{G}{-}^*\), which we have already shown to be left-exact; the category \(\Gfmod\) is Noetherian as it's small and its objects are finite.
    Thus, we obtain an inductive system \((I_j)\) and a natural isomorphism
    \[
        \H{n}{G}{-}^* \simeq \varinjlim_j \Hom(-,I_j).
    \]
    Now, set \(I\coloneqq \varinjlim_j I_j\). This is a discrete torsion \(G\)-module, and since \(A\) is finite we conclude:
    \begin{align*}
        \Hom_G(A,I) & \simeq \varinjlim_j \Hom(A,I_j) \\
                    & = \H{n}{G}{A}^*.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rm:Torsion}
    We can generalize Theorem \ref{thm:DualMod} to discrete torsion \(G\)-modules, just by writing such an \(A\) as the inductive limit of its finite submodules \(A=\displaystyle\varinjlim_{\mathclap{\substack{B\subset A \\B\text{ finite}}}}{B}\):
    \begin{align*}
        \H{n}{G}{A}^* & =\varprojlim \H{n}{G}{B}^*     \\
                      & \simeq \varprojlim \Hom_G(B,I) \\
                      & = \Hom_G(A,I).
    \end{align*}
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}\label{rm:pTorsion}
    If we only consider profinite groups of finite \(p\)-cohomological dimension \(n\), the analogue of Theorem \ref{thm:DualMod} holds with the same proof, provided we further restrict ourselves to \(p\)-primary torsion modules (as the \(n\)-th cohomology functor is right-exact on the corresponding subcategory)
\end{remark}

Let us now embark on the proof of Lemma \ref{lm:IndRep}, which is
due to Grothendieck (in the case of an Artinian category, see \cite{Grothendieck} \S 3):
\begin{proof}
    A pair \((A,x)\), for \(A\) in \(\mathcal{C}\) and \(x\) in \(F(A)\), is called
    \textbf{minimal} if \(x\notin F(B)\) for each surjection \(B\twoheadrightarrow A\) with a non-trivial kernel. This makes sense as for \(F\) left-exact we can view \(F(B)\) as a subobject of \(F(A)\); we shall use this repeatedly in the following.

    Given two pairs \((A,x)\) and \((B,y)\), we say that \((A,x)\) \textbf{dominates} \((B,y)\) if there is a morphism \(p:A\to B\) such that \(F(p)(y)=x\).

    Using the Noetherian hypothesis, we can show that every pair \((A,x)\) is dominated by a minimal pair: to construct it, consider the poset \(\Sigma\) of all subjobects \(A_0 \subset A\) such that \((A/A_0,y)\) dominates \((A,x)\) for some \(y\in F(A/A_0)\)  through the projection morphism \(p:\,A\twoheadrightarrow A/A_0\).
    Taking \(A_0=0\) and \(y=x\) shows that \(\Sigma\) is non-empty: indeed, \(p=\id_A\) and \(F(p)(y)=\id_{F(A)}(y)=x\). Then, by the Noetherian condition \(\Sigma\) admits a maximal element \(A_0\), and we show that \((A/A_0,y)\) is a minimal pair: given \(p^{\prime} :B\twoheadrightarrow A_0\) with \(\ker(p^{\prime})\neq 0\), if \(y\) is in \(F(B)\) we can consider the pair \((B,y)\) and the morphism \(q\coloneqq p^{\prime} \circ p: A\twoheadrightarrow B\). Then, \((B,y)\) dominates \((A,x)\) since
    \[F(q)(y)=F(p)(F(p^{\prime} )(y))=F(p)(y),\]  but then \(B= (A/A_0)/\ker(p^{\prime})\) is a quotient of \(A\) which contradicts the maximality of \(A_0\).

    Furthermore, if \((A,x)\) is dominated by a minimal pair \((B,y)\), we claim that there is a \textit{unique} morphism \(p:A\to B\) such that \(F(p)(y)=x\).
    Indeed, let \(q:A\to B\) be a morphism with \(F(q)(y)=x\), then \[F(p-q)(y)= 0.\]
    Moreover, the surjection \(A\twoheadrightarrow\Im(p-q)\) induces an injective morphism \(F(\Im(p-q))\hookrightarrow F(A)\), and composing it with the inclusion \(i: \Im(p-q)\hookrightarrow A\) we get a morphism \[F(B)\overset{F(i)}{\to} F(\Im(p-q))\hookrightarrow F(A)\] which sends \(y\) to \(0\), and conclude that \(x\in\ker(F(i))\).

    Finally, taking \(C\) to be the cokernel of \((p-q)\) yields an exact sequence
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:MinSeq}
        0\to\Im(p-q)\overset{i}{\to} B\to C\to 0
    \end{equation}
    which in turn induces an exact sequence
    \[0\to F(C)\to F(B) \to F(\Im(p-q)),\]
    which shows that \(\ker(F(i))=F(C)\), so \(x\) is contained in \(F(C)\). However, by minimality of \((B,y)\) the second
    map in \eqref{eq:MinSeq} is an isomorphism, which means that \(p=q\).

    The set of minimal pairs can be ordered by setting \((A,x)\leq (B,y)\) if \((A,x)\) dominates \((B,y)\). This defines an inductive system \((I_j,x_j)\), as any two minimal pairs \((I_j,x_j)\) and \((I_k,x_k)\) are dominated by their direct sum \(\left(I_j\oplus I_k,(x_j,x_k)\right)\), which is itself dominated by a minimal pair.

    We thus get a canonical element \(x\coloneqq (x_j)\) of \(F(I)\coloneqq \varprojlim_j F(I_j)\), which we use to define a functorial homomorphism

    \[
        \phi: \; \varinjlim_j \Hom(A,I_j)\longrightarrow F(A),
    \]

    by sending \(f\coloneqq (f_j)\) to \(F(f)(x)\). This is well defined because \(\Hom\) preserves limits, and so
    \[
        F(f)\in\varinjlim_j{\Hom(F(I_j),F(A))}=\Hom(F(I),F(A)).
    \]

    Finally, we show that \(\phi\) is an isomorphism: if \((f_j)\) is sent to \(0\), then for any \(j\) the two morphisms
    \[
        F(f_j), F(0):\; F(I_j) \to F(A)
    \]
    both send \(x_j\) to \(0.\) Since \((I_j,x_j)\) is a minimal a pair which dominates \((A,0)\), we deduce that \(f_j\) must be the zero morphism, and by arbitrariety of \(j\) we get injectivity.

    For surjectivity, given any \(y\in F(A)\) we know that \((A,y)\) is dominated by a minimal pair \((I_j,x_j),\) so there is a unique \(f_j:\, A\to I_j\) satisfying \(F(f_j)(x_j)=y.\) Then, the limit of the \(f_j\) is sent by \(\phi\) to \(y,\) and we are done.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
    We can view the functorial isomorphism \eqref{eq:FuncIso} as a \textbf{perfect pairing} of \textit{torsion} groups (in light of Remark \ref{rm:Torsion}, which in particular applies to $A=I$):
    \[
        \langle-,-\rangle_A:\,\Hom_G(A,I)\times\H{n}{G}{A}\longrightarrow\Q /\Z.
    \]
\end{remark}

For any \(G\)-module \(A\), consider the abelian group
\[
    A^{\prime}\coloneqq \Hom_\Z(A,I),
\]
which we make into a \(G\)-module by setting
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TateTwist}
    (\sigma\cdot f)(a)=\sigma\cdot(f(\sigma^{-1}\cdot a)).
\end{equation}

This action induces a pairing of \(G\)-modules
\begin{align*}
    A^\prime\times A & \to I         \\
    (f,a)            & \mapsto f(a),
\end{align*}
and thus a cup product
\[
    \H{0}{G}{A^\prime}\times\H{n}{G}{A}\overset{\cup}{\longrightarrow}\H{n}{G}{I}
\]

which is related to the dual of cohomology by
\[
    \H{0}{G}{A^{\prime}} = \Hom_G(A,I).
\]
Indeed, the group \(\H{0}{G}{A^{\prime} }\) consists of the \(G\)-invariants of \(A^{\prime} = \Hom_\Z(A,I)\), and so
\[
    \H{0}{G}{A^{\prime}} = (\Hom_\Z(A,I))^G = \Hom_G(A,I).
\]

We will need the following compatibility of the cup product with the duality pairing:

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:CompatCupDual}
    In the situation of the previous definition, the pairing \(\langle-,- \rangle_A\) factors through the cup product and the homomorphism \(i\coloneqq \langle \id_I,-\rangle_I: \H{n}{G}{I}\to \Q/\Z\), i.e. the following diagram commutes:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {\H{0}{G}{A^\prime}  \times \H{n}{G}{A}} \ar[swap, rd, "\langle - {,} - \rangle_A "] \ar[r, "\cup"] & \H{n}{G}{I} \ar[d, "i"] \\
            & \Q/\Z.
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Any morphism \(f\in\Hom_G(A,I)\) induces a homomorphism in cohomology
    \[
        f^*:\, \H{n}{G}{A}\to\H{n}{G}{I},
    \]
    and by composition on the left a homomorphism
    \[
        f_*:\, \Hom_G(I,I)\to\Hom_G(A,I)
        .\]
    Now, writing out the functorality of the dualizing module gives the following commutative diagram:
    \[
        \tikzset{
            symbol/.style={
                    draw=none,
                    every to/.append style={
                            edge node={node [sloped, allow upside down, auto=false]{$#1$}}}
                }
        }
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Hom_G(A,I) \arrow[r,symbol=\times] &[-2em] \ar[dd, "f^*"] \H{n}{G}{A} \ar[rd, "\langle - {,} - \rangle_A "] &[2em] \\
            && \Q/\Z \\
            \Hom_G(I,I)  \arrow[r,symbol=\times] \ar[uu, "f_*"] & \H{n}{G}{I}  \ar[swap, ru, "\langle - {,} - \rangle_I "]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]

    As remarked in \ref{rm:Cup0n}, here the cup product of \(f\in\H{0}{G}{A^{\prime}}\) with some \(\alpha\in\H{n}{G}{A}\) is given by
    \( f^*(\alpha) \). Since \(f_*\) clearly sends \(\id_I\) to \(f\), the above diagram implies that
    \[
        \langle f, \alpha \rangle_A = \langle \id_I, f^*(\alpha)\rangle_I=i(f\cup\alpha).
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    It follows that the pair \((I,i)\) is unique up to unique isomorphism.
\end{corollary}

Before moving on to the computation of the dualizing module of the absolute Galois group of a \(p\)-adic field, we need a lemma about dualizing modules of open subgroups:

\begin{lemma}\label{lm:dualOpenSgr}
    Let \(G\) be a profinite group of finite cohomological dimension \(n\) such that \(\H{n}{G}{A}\) is finite for all \(A\in\Gfmod\). If \(U\subset G\) is an open subgroup and \(I\) is the dualizing module of \(G\), then \(I\) (viewed as an \(U\)-module) is the dualizing module of \(U\), and the homomorphism
    \[
        \H{n}{U}{A}\to\H{n}{G}{A}
    \]
    defined by dualizing the inclusion \(i:\Hom_G(A,I) \hookrightarrow \Hom_U(A,I) \) is simply the corestriction.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    As \(U\) is open and \(\cd(G)<\infty\), by Proposition \ref{ineqCd} we get \(\cd(U)=\cd(G)\). By uniqueness of the dualizing module, it's enough to show that \(\H{n}{U}{-}^*\simeq\Hom_U(-,I)\), and then the first claim follows from the functorial isomorphisms
    \begin{align*}
        \H{n}{U}{A}^* & \simeq \H{n}{G}{\mathrm{I}_G^U(A)}   & \text{(Shapiro)}                               \\
                      & \simeq \Hom_G(\mathrm{I}_G^U(A),\,I) & \text{($I$ is the dualizing module of $G$)}    \\
                      & \simeq \Hom_U(A,\,I)                 & \text{(by Proposition \ref{prop:IndLeftAdj})}.
    \end{align*}
    For the second claim, recall from remark \ref{rm:Cor} that the corestriction homomorphism is induced by the surjective morphism of \(G\)-modules
    \[\mathrm{I}_G^U(A) \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} A\]
    defined as
    \[ \pi(f)= \sum_{g\in G/U}{g\cdot f(g^{-1})}.\]
    On the other hand, $\pi$ induces a morphism of modules \(\Hom_G(A,I)\overset{\pi_*}{\longrightarrow}\Hom_G(\mathrm{I}_G^U(A),I)\).
    Using the functoriality of the dualizing module and the Shapiro isomorphism $\sh$ \eqref{eq:Shapiro},
    we get the following commutative diagram:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small, row sep=large]
            \Hom_U(A,I)
            \rar["\Phi"] &
            \Hom_G(\mathrm{I}_G^U(A), I)
            \rar &
            \H{n}{G}{\mathrm{I}_G^U(A)}^*
            \rar["(-)^*"]&\H{n}{G}{\mathrm{I}_G^U(A)}
            \rar["\sh\ "]
            \ar[d, "\Cor"]&\H{n}{U}{A}\ar[dl] \\
            &
            \Hom_G(A,I) \ar[swap, lu, "i"]
            \ar[u, "\pi_*"]
            \rar &
            \H{n}{G}{A}^*
            \ar[u,"\pi_n^*"]
            \rar["(-)^*"] &
            \H{n}{G}{A} \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    Here, $\Phi$ is the isomorphism of Proposition \ref{prop:IndLeftAdj},
    which makes the leftmost triangle commute as
    \[
        \pi_*(\varphi)(f) = \varphi\left(\sum\nolimits_{g\in G/U}\;{g\cdot f(g^{-1} )}\right) = \sum\nolimits_{g\in G/U}\;{g\cdot \varphi(f(g^{-1}))} = (\Phi\circ i) (\varphi)(f)
    \]
    for any \(\varphi\in\Hom_G(A,I)\) and \(f\in\mathrm{I}_G^U(A)\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computation for p-adic Fields}

Finally, we apply the theory of dualizing modules to the absolute Galois group \(\Gamma\) of a \(p\)-adic field \(\K\): by \ref{thm:CohomFin} we know that \(\cd(\Gamma)=2\), and by \ref{cor:FinCohom} the groups \(\H{2}{\K}{A}\) are finite for any finite \(\Gamma_{\K}\)-module $A$. Thus, by Theorem \ref{thm:DualMod} \(\Gamma\) has a dualizing module \(I\), which we now compute.

\begin{proposition}
    The dualizing module of \(\Gamma\) is canonically isomorphic to the \(\Gamma\)-module of roots of unity \(\mu\subset\Kx\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $I_n\coloneqq I[n]$ be the kernel of multiplication by $n$ on $I$, and take an open subgroup $U\subset\Gamma$. By Lemma \ref{lm:dualOpenSgr}, the dualizing module of $U$ is the same as that of $\Gamma$.

    Moreover, by Theorem \ref{thm:CohomMuN} we know that \(\H{2}{U}{\mu_n}\simeq\Zn\), and by \ref{thm:padicBrauer} the corestriction $\Br{K^U}\to\Br{K}$ is the identity of $\Q/\Z$.

    Thus, if $U\subset V$ are open subgroups of $\Gamma$, the second part of Lemma \ref{lm:dualOpenSgr} yields the following commutative diagram:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:FuncDual}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Hom_V(\mu_n,I_n)
            \ar[d]
            \ar[r] &
            \H{2}{V}{\mu_n}^*
            \ar[d, "\Cor^*=\,\id"]
            \rar["\sim"] &
            \Zn
            \ar[equal, d] \\
            \Hom_U(\mu_n,I_n)
            \ar[r] &
            \H{2}{U}{\mu_n}^*
            \rar["\sim"] &
            \Zn.
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    This shows that \(\H{2}{U}{\mu_n}\) doesn't depend on \(U\), and by Remark \ref{rm:discGmodUnion} we get
    \[
        \Hom_\Z(\mu_n,I_n)=\bigcup_{\mathclap{\substack{U\subset\,\Gamma\\U\text{ open}}}}{\Hom_U(\mu_n,I_n)}\simeq\Zn
    \]
    In particular, taking $U$ to be $\Gamma$ tells us that $\Gamma$ acts trivially on $\Hom_\Z(\mu_n,I_n)$, or equivalently that any homomorphism $\mu_n\to I_n$ is $\Gamma$-equivariant.

    Let $f_n$ be the canonical generator of $\Hom_\Z(\mu_n,I_n)$ associated with $1\in\Zn$. Then $f_n$ is injective because it has order $n$, and surjective because otherwise any element outside its image wouldn't be reached by any element of $\langle f_n\rangle=\Hom_\Z(\mu_n,I_n)$, but as $I_n$ has exponent $n$ there are homomorphisms $\mu_n\to I_n$ sending a generator of $\mu_n$ to any element of $I_n$.

    By writing $\mu = \bigcup_n{\mu_n}$ and $I = \bigcup_n{I[n]}$, we get an isomorphism of $\Gamma$-modules, which is well defined thanks to the functoriality of the dualizing module, and canonical because by the map $\H{2}{\Gamma}{\mu_m}\to\H{2}{\Gamma}{\mu_n}$ induces (through $\H{2}{\Gamma}{\mu_n}\simeq\Zn$) the canonical injection $\Z/m\Z\hookrightarrow\Zn$ if $m$ divides $n$.
    % TODO: controlla meglio/annota l'errore della riga sopra nel libro
    \[
        f\coloneqq \varinjlim_n f_n:\, \mu\Iso I.
    \]
\end{proof}

\section{Tate Duality}
We now define yet another type of duality for finite groups:
\begin{definition}
    Given a field \(\K\), let  $\Gamma$ be its absolute Galois group and $\mu$ the group of all the roots of unity in $\Kx$.
    For any finite \(\Gamma\) -module \(M\) whose torsion is prime to the characteristic of \(\K\), we define the \textbf{Cartier dual} of $M$ as
    \begin{equation*}
        M^{\prime} = \Hom_{\Z}(M, \Kx)=\Hom_{\Z}(M, \mu),
    \end{equation*}
    with the action of $\Gamma$ given by
    \begin{equation*}
        (\sigma \cdot f)(m) = \sigma(f(\sigma^{-1}\cdot m)),
    \end{equation*}
    just as we did in \eqref{eq:TateTwist}.
    Notice that with this action, if $M=\mu_n$, then its dual $M^{\prime} = \Hom_{\Z}(\mu_n, \mu_n)$ is isomorphic to $\Zn$ as a $\Gamma$-module.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\K$ be a p-adic field, and $M$ a finite $\Gamma$-module.
    Then, for $i=0,1,2$ the cup product induces a perfect pairing of finite groups
    \begin{equation*}
        H^i(\K, M) \times H^{2-i}(\K, M^{\prime}) \to H^2(\K, \mu) \cong \Q/\Z.
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We have already proved the finiteness of the groups involved in \ref{cor:FinCohom}, so we only need to show that the pairing is perfect.
    We start from $i=2$, where our computation of the dualizing module pays off: indeed, the content of Lemma \ref{lm:CompatCupDual}
    in this situtation consists of the following commutative diagram
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            {\H{0}{\K}{M^\prime}  \times \HH{\K}{M}} \ar[swap, rd, "\langle - {,} - \rangle_M "] \ar[r, "\cup"] & \HH{\K}{\mu} \ar[d, "i"] \\
            & \Q/\Z,
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    where
    \[
        i = \langle \id_{\Q/\Z}, - \rangle : \H{2}{\K}{\mu} \Iso \Q/\Z.
    \]
    Since \(\langle -{,}- \rangle_M\) is a perfect pairing, we are done.

    The case $i=0$ then follows by symmetry, as any finite $M$ can be identified with its double dual $M''$.
    We are now left with $i=1$: here it's enough to show that the map
    \[
        \H{1}{\K}{M} \overset{\cup}{\to} \H{1}{\K}{M^\prime}^*
    \]
    induced by the cup product is injective, as then applying the same argument to $M^\prime$ gets us surjectivity, since we are working with finite groups.
    To prove injectivity, we first find a finite $\Gamma$-module $B$ fitting in an exact sequence
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:InjSeq}
        0\to M\to B\to C\to 0
    \end{equation}
    such that the induced map
    \[
        \H{1}{\K}{B}\to\H{1}{\K}{B}
    \]
    is zero:
    as usual, we start by injecting $M$ in the induced module $\Ind{\Gamma}{M}$ which is torsion, and by the fundamental property \ref{thm:IndLim} we have

    \[
        0=\H{n}{\K}{\Ind{\Gamma}{M}}=\varinjlim_{\substack{B\subset\Ind{\Gamma}{M} \\B\text{ finite}}}{\H{n}{\K}{B}},
    \]
    which implies the existence of a finite submodule \(B\) with \(\H{n}{\K}{B}=0\). As \(M\) is finite, we can find such a \(B\) which contains \(M\), and then
    the quotient \(C=B/M\) is finite as well.
    Now, we can relate the long exact sequences in cohomology associated with the short exact sequence \eqref{eq:InjSeq}
    and its dual using the cup product, which gets us the following commutative diagram (up to a sign, by \ref{prop:CompatCupDiff}) with exact rows:
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \H{0}{\K}{B} \ar[r] \ar[d, "\cup"] & \H{0}{\K}{C} \ar[r] \ar[d, "\cup"] & \H{1}{\K}{M} \ar[d, "\cup"] \ar[r] & 0 \\
            \H{2}{\K}{B^\prime}^* \ar[r] & \H{2}{\K}{C^\prime}^* \ar[r] & \H{1}{\K}{M^\prime}^*.
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    As \(B\) and \(C\) are finite, the first two vertical maps are isomorphisms by the previous cases, and the third one is injective by diagram chasing.

\end{proof}

% TODO Remark: The theorem also holds local fields of positive characteristic and p-torsion-free modules by <ref>

\subsection{Local Class Field Theory}

Let K be a $p$-adic field with absolute Galois group $\Gamma$. As an immediate application of the local duality theorem, since for any $n>0$ the Cartier dual of the $\Gamma$-module $\mu_n$ is $\Zn$ the cup product induces an isomorphism


\[
    \H{1}{K}{\mu_n} \Iso \H{1}{K}{\Zn}^*.
\]

Recall that the groups $\K^{\times n}$

% For the chain of isomorphisms, need: remark that the bidual of a (non-necessarily abelian) profinite group is isomorphic to the original group.
